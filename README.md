Custom modal transition
=====================

This transition supports both landscape and portrait modes. However, controllers will not properly rotate if orientation changed when presented. There is only one exception, if presented controller is a navigation controller, then rotation works fine.

Currently it works fine on iOS 7 and iOS 8 beta 5.
